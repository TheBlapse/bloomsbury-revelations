# Bloomsbury Revelations Books
Books from Bloomsbury's Revelations series. It appears to be a good selection of works to me. Likely I will never read all of it, so let's see what to do with all of it. We shall do some scrapping and something more. Contribute if you may. Here is the list with links to Bloomsbury's website.
